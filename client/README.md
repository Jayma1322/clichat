# CLIChat Official Client
This is the official client for CLIChat. <br>
As of the merging of #2, the client is now `secure-client`, previously just called `client` or `clichat-client`. 

## Contributing
If you would like to contribute, please do (unless your addition is pointless - tidying code is NOT useless!). <br>
The `clear console log history` method is very buggy and inefficient, and if anyone has a better way of doing it **make a pull request, ASAP.** <br>
All present bugs with the client are labeled with the `client` tag in the issues tab. 

## How do I write a custom client?
Utilise the API. Description is in the [main README](https://github.com/sudocode1/clichat/blob/master/README.md).
