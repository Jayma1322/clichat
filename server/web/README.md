# Web Client
The web client (Web Client v1) is a new client, that is hosted on `http://<SERVERIP>:SERVERPORT`.

## Secure Server support
Secure Server support will be worked on when SAUTHv2 has been implemented in Secure Servers. <BR> This will be in Web Client v2 - meaning the soon-to-be "legacy" (v1) style will **never** be officially supported - unless someone decides to make a pr adding v1 support for Secure Server, however this will be overwritten with Web Client v2.

## How to use
There is not much you need to configure. <br>
Go to `index.html` and edit the `options` object to your liking and replace `YOUR_SERVER_IP` to your server ip and port.
